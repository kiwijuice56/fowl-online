# Fowl! Online
Fowl is an online recreation of the classic card game, Rook, using Godot 4. The server (to be configured later) runs on Linode to connect players together and simulate the game. Fowl is completely open-source and free. Contact the author (alfaroeric127@gmail.com) if you run into any issues or bugs.

## How To Play
1. On the first screen, create a profile with your username (typed in the box) and a profile image (selected with the arrows). No data is stored for your player; Your profile is only a temporary visual representation of your user and it is deleted when the game is closed. Click "Go" when complete.

2. If you plan to invite your friends, click "Create Game". A three-word code will be automatically generated. Copy this code and send it to your friends! Instruct them to click "Join Game" from the main menu, paste the code into the box, and press "Go". When all four players are in the game, the host must press "Start Game".
